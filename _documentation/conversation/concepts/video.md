# Video

Stitch allows for the creation of a Conversation with the property of
type `video`. This allows for audio-visual communication.

Screen capture is also supported with the correct browser plugin (you can
easily create one).

Video streams can be enabled and disabled in a Conversation so that Members can communicate with video.

## Media Events

Media events will fire in a Conversation when media state changes for a member. This can be when a Video stream is started or ended.

## Member Media Events

Media events will fire on a Member when media state changes for a member. This can be when a Video stream is started or ended.
